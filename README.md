# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
PH-Analysisi Module 7 

## Project Overview

The project was very useful in order to understand how databases behave along with each other. Understanding the structure and the relationships between different datasets is the key to build logical and useful databases mixing information from diferent sources with the help of data engeniering tools such as SQL, Jupyter, pandas etc. In this particular case, the prefered tool was SQL, and the logic behind SQL ain't complex once you get how data keys work together, how the order of the inputs affect the results, and how assigining the correct keys make the difference in our final results. 
Also understandig how joints work is fundamental into making the right choices to build datasets that make sense for analytics. 
It all start making sense once the challenge is finished, Pyhon, Pandas and SQL as one realizes is more about developing a thinking methodology rather than actually becoming a pro in a specific programming language, understanding applications is enough for starters as Google becomes a very helpful ally.

### Results

- At first glance we know we have 133,776 employees that may retire.

Retiring_employees_by_title

Once we filter with the proper criteria, eliminating duplications and keeping only those still in the company we conclude we have almost 50% of thos initial employees. 
- 72,458 Retiring Employees should be replaced.

Retiring_titles

-  1,549 Mentorship Possible Candidates
-  Therefore if all of them where to mentor the next generation, it would be ona relationship of 1 mentor per 47 alumni. That wouldn't be very efficient.

Mentorship Programs

Conclusion:
- It's important to rethink if all the positions should remain the same, as this generation used to work with different tools and methdologies, it may be wise to reconsider the functions on the new roles. 
- A strong mentorship program would be needed, maybe supported by online courses (Like this) in which a single mentor could help a big group of students, otherwise the capabilites would not be sufficient to cover all the personal.
